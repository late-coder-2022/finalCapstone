"""
This is the capstone database project to create an ebookstore system. Bookstore clerks can add, change, delete and
search books via the system.

From working with this project, the following is learnt and considered.

- When using fetchall(), it returns "0" when the result set is empty but fetchone() returns
"None". Therefore, it has to be careful in writing code for these two functions.

- When designing the search options, normal situations is considered. For example, an option for user to list out all
the books in the system when he/she has no idea what is in the system. For experience staff, they can use book id, title
or author as searching criteria to quickly located the book they want.

- As the "id" field in the books table is defined as INTEGER PRIMARY KEY (rowid), its value will be auto-incremented and
generated when a new record is added. Therefore, users only need to provide the value for the title, author and quantity
field when adding new books.

- Users are offered a chance to double confirm before making change to the database.

- Define validation and checking on users' input throughout the program to handle predictable errors.

START
1. Create a database "ebookstore"
2. Create a table "books"
3. Load data into the table. This only happens when the table has no record.
4. Create a user menu for bookstore clerk to add, update, delete and search books
5. Define specific functions for add, update, delete and search books.
